# Autoland for GeoFS

## How to install

1. Install extentions.zip
2. Extract both .js files
3. Install TamperMonkey on your browser.
4. Press the plus button in the top right.
5. Delete everything that automatically fills in the code space.
6. Drag in AP++.js. (it will take a while to load due to the size of the file)
7. Ctrl+S
8. Repeat steps 4-7, replacing AP++.js with FMC.js
9. If necessary, delete the old AP++ and FMC

## How to use

This AP++ and FMC can be used just as the previous ones. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzLkkoTBRQY) outlines how the old AP++ and FMC could be used. When you open GeoFS, you can load a route into the FMC and fly like normal.  However, it is now possible to have the autopilot land for you. This was made possible by some tinkering around in the scripts. Currently, you have to use an FMC route to land automatically, but this will be changed in the upcoming future. Premade routes are being made and will be uploaded shortly.
