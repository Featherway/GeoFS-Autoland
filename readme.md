# Autoland for GeoFS

## How to install

1. If necessary, delete the old AP++ and FMC
2. Install extentions.zip
3. Extract the code folder.
4. Install TamperMonkey on your browser.
5. Press the plus button in the top right.
6. Delete everything that automatically fills in the code space.
7. Drag in AP++.js from the code folder. (it will take a while to load due to the size of the file)
8. Ctrl+S
9. Repeat steps 4-7, replacing AP++.js with FMC.js

## How to use

This AP++ and FMC can be used just as the previous ones. [This video](https://youtu.be/5O5_8ihgk5I) outlines how the AP++ and FMC can be installed and used. [This video](https://youtu.be/PI3-T5HNu8Y) teaches you how to make an FMC route you can use to autoland. When you open GeoFS, you can load a route into the FMC and fly like normal.  However, it is now possible to have the autopilot land for you. This was made possible by some tinkering around in the scripts. Currently, you have to use an FMC route to land automatically, but this may be changed in the upcoming future. Premade routes are still being made and are in the routes.md file.
